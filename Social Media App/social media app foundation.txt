Building a social media clone with those features is an excellent project to showcase your skills. Here's a high-level plan to help you get started:

### Project Structure

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user registration and login using JWT for secure authentication.
   - Create user profile pages to display personal information, profile pictures, and posts.

2. **Posts**:
   - Allow users to create, edit, delete, and like posts.
   - Display posts in a feed, sorted by date or popularity.

3. **Comments**:
   - Enable users to comment on posts.
   - Allow users to edit and delete their comments.

4. **Real-Time Chat**:
   - Use WebSockets (e.g., Socket.io) for real-time communication.
   - Create chat rooms or direct messaging between users.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up Your Environment**:
   - Install Node.js, MongoDB, and React.
   - Create a new React app and set up a Node.js/Express backend.

2. **Backend Setup (Express & MongoDB)**:
   - Set up routes and controllers for user authentication, posts, and comments.
   - Define MongoDB schemas for users, posts, and comments.

3. **Frontend Setup (React)**:
   - Create components for the user interface: Login, Signup, Profile, PostFeed, Post, Comment, Chat.
   - Use React Router for navigation.

4. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement JWT-based authentication.
   - Create protected routes in your React app for authenticated users.

5. **Posts and Comments**:
   - Implement CRUD operations for posts and comments.
   - Set up Redux or Context API for state management.

6. **Real-Time Chat**:
   - Integrate Socket.io for real-time chat functionality.
   - Create a chat component and manage real-time updates with WebSocket events.

7. **Styling and UX**:
   - Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI for styling.
   - Ensure the user interface is responsive and user-friendly.

8. **Testing and Deployment**:
   - Test your application thoroughly.
   - Deploy your app using platforms like Heroku (backend) and Netlify (frontend).

### Example Code Snippet

Here's a basic example of setting up a WebSocket server with Socket.io:

#### Backend (Node.js/Express)
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const socketIo = require('socket.io');

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = socketIo(server);

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('New client connected');
  
  socket.on('message', (data) => {
    io.emit('message', data);
  });

  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('Client disconnected');
  });
});

server.listen(4000, () => console.log('Server is running on port 4000'));
```

#### Frontend (React)
```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import io from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('http://localhost:4000');

const Chat = () => {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    socket.on('message', (message) => {
      setMessages((prevMessages) => [...prevMessages, message]);
    });

    return () => {
      socket.off('message');
    };
  }, []);

  const sendMessage = () => {
    socket.emit('message', input);
    setInput('');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {messages.map((message, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{message}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <input value={input} onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={sendMessage}>Send</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Chat;
```
